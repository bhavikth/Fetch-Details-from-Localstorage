# get-token-chrome-extension

If you want to get the Tenant ID and the Bearer Token, you can use this Extension which I created, no need to use your network tab and refresh it. Just unzip this in your laptop.

 How to install it locally on your laptop -

1.) Go to chrome://extensions/ in your chrome browser in your URL.

2.) Turn on your Developer Mode toggle on top right hand side.

3.) Then on the left hand side, click on Load Unpacked option.

4.) Unzip the given zipped folder and select the unzipped folder.



You will then see the extension with key icon in your browser's window and with one button click - you can get both Tenant ID and Bearer Token from any environment.

No need to Inspect and open you network tab and reload your page.
